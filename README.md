Scope of the project: 
•	Developing a robust understanding of Facial Expression Recognition (FER) and its applications in computer vision and machine learning.
•	Building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch to classify facial expressions into two emotion categories: Angry and Happy.
•	Preprocessing the Fer-2013 dataset and splitting it into training and testing sets.
•	Training the model on the training set and evaluating its performance on the testing set.
•	Testing the model’s generalization ability by passing new and unseen images to model and identifying their corresponding emotion category as happy or angry.
